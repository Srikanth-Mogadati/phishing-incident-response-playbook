# USB / Removable Media Investigation Playbook

> **SOC Analyst Portfolio Project** — Endpoint device events, removable-media tracking, file activity, policy validation, evidence documentation.

**Portfolio timeline:** October 2025  
**Series:** SOC Incident Response Playbooks  
**Note:** This is a lab/portfolio playbook. Adapt actions to organizational policy, authorization, evidence-retention rules, and approved tools.

## Investigation Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A([Removable Media Alert]) --> B[Identify user, host and device]
B --> C[Review mount time, serial/device ID and policy]
C --> D[Identify files copied to/from media]
D --> E{Authorized business use?}
E -- Yes --> F[Document and close]
E -- No --> G[Assess sensitive data exposure or malware introduction]
G --> H[Search endpoint for executed files and related processes]
H --> I{Security impact confirmed?}
I -- No --> J[Document and monitor]
I -- Yes --> K[Contain endpoint/device and preserve evidence]
K --> L[Escalate to IR/DLP as appropriate]
L --> Z([End])
```

## Objectives

- Triage the alert consistently and establish scope.
- Correlate identity, endpoint, network, and security telemetry.
- Separate benign activity from suspicious or confirmed malicious behavior.
- Preserve evidence and document analyst reasoning.
- Apply containment only when authorized and supported by evidence.
- Escalate with a clear timeline, IOCs, affected assets, and actions taken.

## Initial Triage Checklist

1. Record alert source, timestamp, severity, user/account, host/device, and relevant IPs.
2. Establish the investigation time window and preserve original evidence.
3. Validate whether the alert corresponds to expected business activity.
4. Look for successful follow-on activity, related alerts, and repeat indicators.
5. Search across the environment to determine whether the activity is isolated or widespread.
6. Record every containment or remediation action in the case ticket.

## Evidence to Collect

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Identity | Account, authentication result, MFA, source IP, application |
| Endpoint | Hostname, process tree, command line, file hashes, device events |
| Network | Source/destination IP, DNS, domain/URL, proxy/firewall activity |
| Timeline | First seen, last seen, related successful/failed events |
| Context | Asset owner, business purpose, approved change or travel |
| Response | Isolation, blocking, reset/revocation, quarantine, escalation |

## Splunk SPL Example

```spl
index=endpoint (usb OR removable)
| stats values(device_id) values(file_name) by host, user, action
```

Use the query as a starting point and tune field names, indexes, thresholds, and allowlists to the lab or production environment.

## Microsoft Sentinel / Defender KQL Example

```kusto
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType has_any ("UsbDriveMounted","RemovableStoragePolicyTriggered")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, AdditionalFields
```

Validate the results against other telemetry before taking action. A single query hit should not be treated as proof of compromise.

## Analyst Decision Points

**Benign / expected:** document the evidence that explains the behavior and close according to procedure.

**Suspicious / inconclusive:** preserve evidence, increase monitoring, enrich IOCs, and escalate when the available evidence is insufficient for a confident disposition.

**Confirmed malicious:** contain affected assets or accounts only within authorization, scope the incident across the environment, remediate the root cause, and document the complete timeline.

## Containment & Remediation

Depending on the scenario and organizational authorization:

- Isolate affected endpoints.
- Disable, restrict, or reset compromised accounts.
- Revoke active sessions/tokens.
- Block confirmed malicious domains, IPs, URLs, or hashes.
- Remove malicious files, persistence, rules, or unauthorized privileges.
- Search for additional affected users/devices before declaring containment complete.
- Preserve evidence needed for incident response, legal, HR, or compliance review.

## MITRE ATT&CK Context

T1091 – Replication Through Removable Media when supported by evidence. Map additional techniques only when they are supported by observed evidence rather than assumed from the alert name.

## Skills Demonstrated

Endpoint device events, removable-media tracking, file activity, policy validation, evidence documentation.

## Safety & Portfolio Disclaimer

This repository is intended for defensive cybersecurity education and portfolio demonstration. Queries use generic example schemas and require adaptation. Do not perform containment, account changes, blocking, or forensic actions in systems you are not authorized to administer.
